## Overview

This is a Unity-based prototype for a 3-way directional endless runner set in a natural environment designed with HCI principles in mind. The player can move **left**, **right**, or **jump** to avoid dynamically generated obstacles and collect coins.  
As gameplay progresses, older sections of the level are destroyed and new ones are procedurally generated.

## Features

- Endless runner mechanics (procedurally generated infinite level)
- Player states (waiting, running, and death states)
- UI Elements (play, restart, best score, current run distance, and collected items)
- Collectibles
- Feedback (screen shake, particle effects, and sound design)
- Visual Clarity (Non-obstructive prefabs (flowers, mushrooms, etc.) enhance immersion without affecting gameplay)
- Music and sound effects (ambient audio and interaction-based SFX)

## How to Play

- **Avoid** trees, rocks, branches, and stumps by jumping or moving
- **Collect coins** to increase your score
- The game ends when you hit a wrong obstacle — try again for a better score!

### Controls

`←` or `A` – Move Left  
`→` or `D` – Move Right  
`↑` or `W` or `Space` – Jump
